// Minimal stub for `@/lib/firebase` used during builds.
// If your project uses Firebase, replace this with your real initialization
// and export of `auth` from 'firebase/auth'. This stub prevents build errors
// when the real file is missing during quick local edits.

// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
export const auth: any = {};

    "A home robot called Mopp beeps hello. A card on its chest shows three rules: be kind, be safe, help. |“Ready to help,” says Mopp.",
    "In the morning, Sam presses the blue button. Mopp says, “Ready!” It sets the table and carries cups carefully. A splash of water drops on the floor. Mopp stops. |“Safe rule—ask for a towel,” it says.",
    "After lunch, a red light blinks. |“Low power,” says Mopp. It rolls to the dock to charge. While charging, it practises a soft voice. |“Indoor voice,” it says, reading the rule card.",
    "In the evening, toys cover the floor. The family and Mopp tidy together. Mopp learns a new task list: “Pick up, sort, put away.” |“Rules help robots and kids,” says Mum."

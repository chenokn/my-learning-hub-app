    "Willow walks to the big old tree on the hill. A soft wind shakes each leaf. The leaves begin to glow like tiny stars. |A whisper says, 'I am the Wish Tree. Make a wish that helps, not just takes.'",
    "Willow sees a small nest on a low branch. A bird chirps nearby. |'I wish the branch would bend so the nest is safe,' says Willow. The branch dips gently, and the bird hops in.",
    "Two children argue under the tree about apples. Willow says, 'Let’s share.' |She makes a wish for a fair gift. Apples drop in twos—one for each child. They smile and say thanks.",
    "'Kind wishes grow more kind,' whispers the tree. |'Do you promise to keep helping?' Willow nods. 'I promise.' She waves and walks home, ready to share her story."

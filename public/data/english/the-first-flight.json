    "Wind whips over sandy dunes at a small airfield. Two brothers check their new plane—wooden frame, canvas wings, and a little engine. |“Ready?” one asks. “Ready,” says the other.",
    "The propeller starts to spin. Put-put-put! The pilot lies on the plane and grips the lever. |Helpers steady the wing tips in the gusty wind.",
    "“Run!” calls a brother. They push the plane over the sand. The engine hums, the wings catch the air, and the nose begins to lift. |The plane rises—up, up—for a short, first flight.",
    "The plane lands safely on the sand. Cheers echo across the dunes. |“A small hop,” says a helper, “but a big change for the world.”"
